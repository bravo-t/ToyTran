# ToyTran: A toy circuit (or rather, network) transient simulator

## STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Supported devices
Voltage: `Vname N+ N- value/pwl(t v t v ...)`

Current: `Iname N+ N- value/pwl(t v t v ...)`

Resistor: `Rname N+ N- value`

Capacitor: `Cname N+ N- value`

Inductor: `Lname N+ N- value`

VCVS: `Ename N+ N- NC+ NC- Value`

VCCS: `Gname N+ N- NC+ NC- Value`

CCVS: `Hname N+ N- NC+ NC- Value`

CCCS: `Fname N+ N- NC+ NC- Value`

## Supported commands and options
`.tran tstep tstop`: Specifies simulation time step and total simulation time.

`.debug 1`: Enable debug output to print MNA matrix and RHS vector, as well as solution to each time step.

`.option method=gear2`: Specifies the method used to perform numerical integration. Valid methods are `euler` (backward Euler) and `gear2` (Gear2 or BDF2). More to come.
