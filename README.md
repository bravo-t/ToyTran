## Supported commands and options

### Commands and options for transient simulation
`.tran [name] tstep tstop`: Specifies simulation time step and total simulation time. The `name` is useful when you would like to run the simulation on the same circuit with different options. `name` part is optional.

`.option [name] method=euler`: Specifies the method used to perform numerical integration. Valid methods are `euler` (backward Euler), `gear2` (Gear2 or BDF2) and `trap` (tapezoidal method).

### Commands and options for pole-zero analysis

`.pz [name] V(OUT) I(IN)`: Perform pole-zero analysis, and calculate pole-residual values for specified output node, and driver admittance at IN node. (The driver admittance part is still under development.)

`.option [name] pzorder=N` will be added, where the `N` means at most N pairs of poles and zeros will be calculated and used to approximate the output waveform.

### Commands and options for STA full stage delay calculation

`.lib lib_file`: Specifies the path of the library file.

`Xinst LibCellName pinA nodeA pinB nodeB ...`: Instantiates the standard cell. `LibCellName` shoule match the one in library file. `pinX` specifies the pin name of the gate cell, and `nodeX` specifies the node connected to `pinX`. 

`.option [name] driver={rampvoltage|current}`: Specifies the driver model of cell timing arcs. `rampvoltage` means a ramp voltage source, in series to a resistor connected to the voltage source, will be used to model the driver pin behavior. The details are described in "Performance computation for precharacterized CMOS gates with RC loads". `current` means a current source will be used to model the driver bahavior. Right now only `rampvoltage` is supported.

`.option [name] loader={fixed|varied}`: Specifies the behavior of the load capacitor of the loader pin. `fixed` means a fixed value will be used for the capacitor, whereas `varied` means the capacitor value will change, and the values come from receiver cap LUT. Right now only `fixed` is supported. 

`.option [name] net={tran|awe}`: Specifies how the RC network will be handled in delay calculation. `tran` means transient simulation will be used to calculate net delay, and `awe` means pole-zero analysis will be used. Right now only `tran` is supported.

`.delay Xinst/output`: Sets the analysis mode to full stage delay calculation. For specifed `Xinst/output` pin, all delay and transition values of the cell arc that connected to the output pin, as well as the net arcs connected from the output pin, are calculated. Internally the `X` devices, or standard cells, will be elaborated with basic devices, thus new devices and nodes will be created, based on the specified driver model and loader model. Specifically:

  `driver=rampvoltage` creates new devices `inst/driverPin/Vd` as the ramp voltage source, `inst/driverPin/Rd` as the resistor connected to the ramp voltage source, and new node `inst/driverPin/VPOS` as the positive terminal of the ramp voltage source. The internal structure of cell instances (include both driver model and loader model) is shown as below:

```

  `driver=current` creates new devices `inst/driverPin/Id` as the current source.

  Loader models are the same on circuit structures, that create new capacitor `inst/loadPin/Cl`. The difference between `fixed` and `varied` are the values of the capacitor.

### Global commands

`.debug [module] 1`: Enable debug output. This command now supports enable debug information for specified modules only, if `module` is omitted, debug information for all modules are enabled. Valid module names are `all` for enabling all modules, `root` for root solver, `sim` for transient simulation, `circuit` for circuit building, `pz` for pole-zero analysis, `nldm` for NLDM delay calculation, and `ccs` for CCS delay calculation.

`.plot tran [width=xx height=xx canvas=xxx] [name.]V(NodeName) [name.]I(DeviceName)`: Generate a simple ASCII plot in terminal for easier debugging. If `width` and `height` directives are not given, the tool will use current terminal size for plot width and height. Multiple simulation results can be plotted in a single chart by specifying a canvas name. Currently at most 4 plots can be drawn in one canvas. Now the command can plot data from different analysis data into one canvas, specified with `name.` prefix. (This command is not supported in PZ analysis.)

`.measure tran[.name] variable_name trig V(node)/I(device)=trigger_value TD=xx targ V(node)/I(device)=target_value`: Measure the event time between trigger value happend and target value happend. (This command is not supported in PZ analysis.)

## Compile and run
`git clone --recurse-submodules` and `make` should be sufficient. The executable is generated under current code directory and named "trans".

To run, just give the executable the spice deck you want to simulate. 

## Examples
`./trans circuit/rc.cir` gives the exponential curve of a capacitor being charged, as well as an example for `.measure` commands.

`./trans circuit/lc.cir` produces a oscillation curve of an LC circuit.

`./trans circuit/xtalk.cir` gives an example of the voltage curve of a capacitor with an aggressor toggling beside it, as well as the canvas-ed `.plot` command.

`./trans circuit/network.cir` gives an example of simulation of a larger RC network.

`./trans circuit/nldm_calc.cir` gives an example of NLDM delay calculation.

## File format of tr0
https://github.com/l-chang/gwave/blob/b362dd6d98c255b35a96d9a69a80563b26c2612c/doc/hspice-output.txt

The output tr0 format still cannot be recognized by waveform viewer tools, not sure where the problem is.

## Features under development

Note below features will not follow spice netlist grammar.

### Transfer function analysis

New instruction `.TF` will be implemented. Details TBD.
